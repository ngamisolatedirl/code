choosing azure with 3 reasons :
- Azure's consumption-based pricing ensures that you are charged only for the resources used. This flexibility enables efficient resource management and cost control. Additionally, Azure provides various pricing tiers and options, allowing businesses to choose the most cost-effective services for their specific needs.
- Scalability in Azure means you can adjust resources dynamically based on demand. This elasticity allows for efficient resource utilization, minimizing operational costs during periods of lower demand. Additionally, features like Azure Autoscale can automate resource scaling based on predefined conditions.
- Azure's cost management tools continue to be valuable during the operational phase. Monitoring and analyzing resource consumption patterns enable organizations to identify areas where optimization can be achieved. This ongoing cost visibility is crucial for maintaining an efficient and cost-effective system.
